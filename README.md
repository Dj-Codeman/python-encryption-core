# python-encryption-core
What ever im doing over in encryption-core I'm trying to better in python 

WHAT IS THIS ?
* Your awnser is as good as mine. Eventually I want to make a gui file locker. In the meantime I assume the cli version needs to exist first.
  This is that. I origianally found a script that used encryption magic im learning about to encrypt files. I didn't know enough about bash
   scripting at the time so I made a seprate script to handle it and give me a more convient syntax for what I was working on. Now I'm just making it          stupidly complicated just messing around with new concepts I learn or want to try.

IS THIS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BASH VERSION ?
* Yes-ish for now Read, Write, Destroy, and initialization will be cross compatible with eachother. I really don't recommemed it though this python version
  will eventually have more complexities that will take awhile to be ported to bash and vice-versa. If the goal is just to mess around or your building some-
  thing using these scripts the go for it. But if you plan on doing something mission critical don't mix the two. Also if you are doing any mission critical
  work I'd recommend using other software, this port and the bash original are just a learning and messing around expirement

HOW ARE YOU SUPPORTING THIS
* Occasionally and naively. I'm new to github and proper progect management and not echo "hereing" my way through debugging. If your invested in this progect hopefully you and pour a little knowlege into me and help make this a cooler thing than it is.
