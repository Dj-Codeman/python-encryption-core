# python-encryption-core
What ever im doing over in encryption-core I'm trying to better in python 

IS THIS COMPATIBLE WITH THE BASH VERSION ?
* Yes-ish for now Read, Write, Destroy, and initialization will be cross compatible with eachother. I really don't recommemed it though this python version
  will eventually have more complexities that will take awhile to be ported to bash and vice-versa. If the goal is just to mess around or your building some-
  thing using these scripts the go for it. But if you plan on doing something mission critical don't mix the two. Also if you are doing any mission critical
  work I'd recommend using other software, this port and the bash original are just a learning and messing around expirement
